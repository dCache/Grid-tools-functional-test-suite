# Grid-tools-functional-test-suite
A collection of functional tests intended to test access with standard Grid protocols, written using the Robot testing framework.

These tests are intended for dcache.org internal CI use.

Historically, these tests were developed at https://github.com/AndyMN/GridTools-Functional-Tests.git during a summer student project at DESY.
